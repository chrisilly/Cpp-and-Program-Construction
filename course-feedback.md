# Course Feedback DA378A: Computer Science: C++ and Program Construction

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Exams should be done digitally using Inspera's dedicated features for writing code
- Need more demonstrations and example-code nearer the beginning of the course

## Content

- I wish we learned more about why `new` and `delete` are religiously avoided in C++ and what `smart pointers` and `templates` are

## Assignments

- We should be given header files with each assignment <!-- with zero implementation or definintions, obviously --> to illustrate exactly what classes and functions need to be defined and implemented. *(Not just through plain-text descriptions.)*

- Each assignment should be git repos that we can fork* <!-- Please stop making us download ZIP files üò© -->
    - Include header files here
    - Include the handout in the form of a markdown (`.md`) file (or a PDF) that details the purpose, requirements, and instructions for the assignment
    - We can hand in by uploading a `release` on GitHub (and then linking to it on canvas or something)

- Never write example code or provide any files containing code written in any language other than English‚Äîor more importantly, never use non-English characters like `√•√§√∂`.
    - [ ] Remove all Swedish from Assignment 3
    - [ ] Remove all Swedish from Assignment 5

- [ ] Review and revise assignments, ensuring that provided code, test code, and header files have internally consistent naming conventions
    - For instance, in assignment 5, `Invariant()` has upper-case beginning while the majority of the code has lower-case beginnings and underscores i.e. `push_back()` or `shrink_to_fit()`

- [ ] As much as possible, divide/delegate the h√∂gskolepo√§ng amongst the assignments so that students are credited per assignment completed rather than having to complete all of them to receive any credit at all
    - Whether it's giving 0.75hp per assignment or giving 0.5hp for assignment 1, 0.5hp for assignment 2, and 1hp each for assignments 3-5, and so on...

**Streamlining course-improvement**

\* You could even go so far as to create **a git repo for the course as a whole**, including each assignment handout in its respective subdirectory. (Alternatively, include each assignment repository as a submodule.)

‚ö†Ô∏è This is where you should be required to include a templated markdown file titled `course-evaluation.md`, `course-feedback.md`, or `kursutv√§rdering.md`. (You can use a markdown-to-PDF exporter to receive these in PDF format.)

It should be somebody's responsibility to compile all of the feedback from these and turn them into actionable points. These should be reviewed and formally recorded by students (course representatives, student union members?) and teachers. **It should also be formally recorded whether the course-responsible or relevant teachers address each actionable point.**
